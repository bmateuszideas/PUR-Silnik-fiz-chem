# ML Baseline Training Report

## Summary
- Dataset: 50 samples, 10 features (synthetic baseline fixture used in tests).
- Objective: train baseline models for `defect_risk` regression and defect classification.

## Evaluation metrics
- MAE (`defect_risk`): 0.0235

## Model artifacts
- `defect_risk`: `/tmp/pytest-of-vscode/pytest-23/test_versioning_feature_compat0/models/defect_risk.pkl`
- `defect_classifier`: `/tmp/pytest-of-vscode/pytest-23/test_versioning_feature_compat0/models/defect_classifier.pkl`

## Notes
- Report generated from local test fixture; paths are temporary and should be regenerated in a stable artifacts location for CI.
